# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Lawrence, and I enjoy Javascript, Java, PHP, and HTML/CSS. I love technology, am a huge food connoisseur, and love cars! I am still new to programming as far as the professional world goes and want to really expand my knowledge and experience to have something to show for.
